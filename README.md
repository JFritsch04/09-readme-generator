# README GENERATOR 
  ## This application uses questions and prompts to obtain user information in order to form a well-formatted README.md file. This is meant for simple use and intended to make user's lives simplier by creating a quick and easy way to generate README files for applications and projects. I used NODE.js to complete this project and learned how to create a professional README and the usage of the inquirer package.
